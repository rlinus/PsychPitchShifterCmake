# PsychPitchShifter
PsychPitchShifter is a software tool for the conduction of psychophysiological
pitch shift experiments that drastically simplifies the
typical experiment setup. It integrates three different pitch shift algorithms. In a pitch shift experiment the subject’s auditory
feedback is manipulated so that it hears it’s own voice shifted
in pitch and it is then observed if the subject adapts to the pitch shift.
Additionally the software provides a feature that allows time-variant
pitch shifts, which can be used as a basis for a new class of experiments.

PsychPitchShifter was created for my semester thesis at ETH Zurich in 2015:

PsychPitchShifter is programmed in C with a MATLAB Mex interface.

*Requirements to run the Mex files:*
